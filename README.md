### Hi there, I am new to GitHub (this is my initial commit) and very excited to be here!ðŸ‘‹


My name is Joel Moran.<br>

Iâ€™m currently working on, well, this README file to update my Profile Page here in the GitHub Community.
<br><br>

I recently started a one-year online course on Full-Stack Web Developer at Beam Institute of Technology. <br>

Eventually, Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborating on projects dealing with AI and Cyber Security. <br>

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with just about everything related to Wed Developing and Coding.<br>

I am interested in nature preservation, environmental protection, and sustainable development alternatives.<br>

You may get in touch with me through email: joelmoran_ph@yahoo.com<br>

âš¡ Fun fact: We currently have a Selkirk Rex and 4 British Short Hair cats.<br>

I will update this About Me Page on GitHub regularly...<br>

Looking forward to meeting you!
